          <h2>Da Hoods Downfall</h2>
<p class="intro">
    It's sad to see this happen, but it's for the best, for the community.
	Da Hoods down fall has already started and will conntinue
		till they shut down their biased money getting
	business.
This is just revenge and fixing up what you broke, don't think this is for attention this is for justice. Da Hood
            	is no more. you've shown us, what a unstable, maniplutative, egotistic, bipolar, community looks like.
 I am truly at a great loss for words, we thought you
                   guy's had some decency, some responsibility, and even some morals when it came to the 
accusations you were held accountable for, but you failed miserably. It is
                 very sad to see it go down this way, You guy's always like to be perceived as a "god." But, how 
could you believe that when you don't even possess the traits of a human 
					            with adequate characteristics, let alone the characteristics 
of a "god". We're here to tell you 
	that you've been conquered, and that you'll remain below all of us.main below all of us.
